# CLI Tasks
Don't want to take your hands off the keyboard to track tasks? I admire your commitment.

## Super simple to use
Requires a running instance of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
Download and NPM Install

Options:
* node tasks.js - this will show the current tasks stored in file
* node tasks.js add - this will prompt you to add a new task and priority
* node tasks.js done - show you current active tasks and prompt you for an ID to mark as completed

All tasks are stored in JSON format for ease of access and legibility.
Stores and tracks the start/complete date of each task.
Status=0 is incomplete, while status=1 is complete.
